# Minesweeper
Clone of a famous Minesweeper Windows game with a built-in solver.

This is my first winforms app, born in 24h from the wild urge that once appeared some Sunday afternoon.
The solver and futher evolution of the app was taking place through the subsequent week.
And finally - here it is!

## Rationale
Minesweeper is a very basic game. Yet, as a human I'm not as efficient in solving the puzzle as a computer is. That was the reason to first create a game clone, and then the built-in mechanism to solve it by applying exactly the same rules as I have applied myself, but to do it much faster.

## Overview
_Maybe I'll add some SSs, gifs and instructions or explanations some time..._
